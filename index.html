                    boards and revised all the rest.</p>
                <p class="mt-1">I assisted the electrical subteam leads in the design of the boards they were
                    responsible for. I played a primary role in the validation of the accumulator management unit (ACU)
                    and
                    tractive system board (TSB), the two boards that control and monitor the battery. Our improvements
                    enabled our maximum pack voltage to increase from 300V to 350V, enhanced driver awareness of vehicle
                    state, and increased the collection of data.</p>
